DESCRIPTION
This program defines a BankAcct class that simulates a basic banking account system. It allows users to: 
Create a bank account with a specified name, account number, initial balance, and interest rate.
Deposit and withdraw money from the account.
Adjust the interest rate.
Calculate the interest earned over a specified number of days.
Display the account details, including balance and interest rate.
A test function demonstrates the usage of the class by performing various operations like deposit, withdrawal, interest rate adjustment, and interest calculation, and then prints out the results.

LOGICAL STEPS
Create the BankAcct class:

Initialize the class with four attributes: name, account_number, amount, and interest_rate.
Define methods for adjusting interest rates, depositing, withdrawing, calculating interest, and displaying the balance.
Define the adjust_interest_rate method:

Update the accountâ€™s interest rate when called with a new value.
Define the deposit method:

Increase the account balance by the deposit amount when called, ensuring that the deposit is positive.
Define the withdraw method:

Decrease the account balance by the withdrawal amount when called, ensuring that the withdrawal does not exceed the available balance and is positive.
Define the calculate_interest method:





VARIABLES
Class Attributes:

name: A string to store the account holder's name.
account_number: A string to store the account number.
amount: A float to store the current balance in the account.
interest_rate: A float to store the interest rate as a percentage.
Method Variables:

new_rate: A float used in the adjust_interest_rate method to store the new interest rate.
amount: A float used in the deposit and withdraw methods to represent the amount of money being deposited or withdrawn.
interest: A float used in the calculate_interest method to store the calculated interest.
