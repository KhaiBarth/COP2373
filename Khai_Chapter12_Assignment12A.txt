In this assignment, I am using exam grades from a previous assignment, and performing calculations to gather the mean, min, max, etc of all exam grades.

LOGICAL STEPS:
Define a Numpy array to store the grades for 10 students across exams

Calculate statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for each exam

Determine the number of students who passed and failed for each exam (above 60)

Calculate the overall pass percentage across all exams

Display all calculated statistics and results to the user



VARIABLES:
grades_data: Numpy array containing grades for 10 students across exams

exam_scores: Contains grades for a specific exam when analyzing its statistics

flat_data: Contains all grades from the dataset for calculating overall statistics

passed: The number of students who passed a particular exam

failed: The number of students who failed a particular exam

total_scores: The total number of grades across all exams

total_passed: The total number of passing grades across all exams

pass_percentage: A float representing the overall percentage of passing grades across all exams





FUNCTIONS:

calculate_exam_statistics(data): Calculate and display mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam

calculate_overall_statistics(data): Calculate and display mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for all grades for all exams combined

pass_fail_counts(data, passing_grade=60): Print the number of students who passed and failed for each exam

passing_grade: The threshold for passing (default is 60)

calculate_overall_pass_percentage(data, passing_grade=60): Calculate and display the overall pass percentage across all exams

passing_grade: The threshold for passing (60)
