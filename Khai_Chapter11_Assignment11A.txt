In this assignment, I am creating a program to simulate a poker game. The user is shown a deck of cards, and then enters a number to quantify how many cards they want to change.




LOGICAL STEPS
-Card and Deck Class Creation:
Define a Card class for individual card representation.

Define a Deck class to create, shuffle, and deal cards.

-Initial Hand Dealing:
Create a shuffled deck and deal a hand of five cards.

-User Input for Card Replacement:
Prompt the user to input which cards to replace, using indices.
Validate the user's input and replace the specified cards.

-Display Final Hand:
Display the final hand after the draw phase.



VARIABLES
deck: An instance of the Deck class representing the shuffled deck.
hand: A list of Card objects representing the initial and updated hands.
replace_indices: A list of indices provided by the user to identify cards to be replaced.



FUNCTIONS
__init__ and __str__ in Card class: To initialize and represent individual cards as strings.
__init__, shuffle, and deal in Deck class: To initialize, shuffle the deck, and deal cards.
display_hand: A function to print the current hand with numbered positions.
main: The main function handling the game flow, including dealing cards, prompting for user input, and displaying results.
