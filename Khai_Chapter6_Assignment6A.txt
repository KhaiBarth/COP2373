In this assignment,  I am creating a function that validates user entered phone numbers, ssn, and zip code. The program reads user input and decides if the data is valid.


LOGICAL STEPS
-Input Gathering: The program prompts the user to enter a phone number, social security number, and zip code.

-Validation: Each input is validated against predefined regular expressions to check for correct formatting.

-Output: The program outputs whether each input (phone number, SSN, and zip code) is valid or invalid.


VARIABLES
phone_number: Stores the user-input phone number.

ssn: Stores the user-input social security number.

zip_code: Stores the user-input zip code.

phone_valid: Boolean value indicating if the phone number is valid.

ssn_valid: Boolean value indicating if the SSN is valid.

zip_valid: Boolean value indicating if the zip code is valid.


FUNCTIONS

validate_phone_number(phone): Validates a phone number using a regular expression.

validate_ssn(ssn): Validates a social security number using a regular expression.

validate_zip_code(zip_code): Validates a zip code using a regular expression.

main(): Orchestrates user input and calls validation Functions, showing final results.
